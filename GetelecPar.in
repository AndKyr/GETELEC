Keep format and params order unchanged. The number should start at 14th column. Don't put spaces at the recognizing string.  The first two lines are always ignored. After the number put a space and the rest is ignored.

debug=       T # if true some error messages are printed
verbose=     T # if true with debug, a lot of error messages and barrier plot
xlim=        0.1 # limit for the usage of KX approximations
nlimfield=   0.6 # limit in 1/n for field regime
nlimthermal= 2.5 # limit for 1/n to go to thermal regime
nmaxlim=     3.0  #maximum acceptable gamma. above it KX is forced
gammalim=    1.e4 # maximum acceptable gamma. above it KX is forced    
varlim=      0.01 #limit of variance for the fitting approximation (has meaning for mode==-2). If the fitting variance is more than varlim we switch to spline mode
epsfit=      1.e-4 #  accuracy required in fittings
Nmaxpoly=    10 #    max degree of the fitted polynomial
spectra=     F #  set to true if you want to output spectroscopy data (T or F)
