Keep format and params order unchanged. Number should start at 14th column. Don't put spaces at the recognizing string. First two lines are always ignored. After the number put a space and the rest is ignored

xlim=        0.05 # limit for the usage of KX approximations
nlimfield=   0.6 # limit in 1/n for field regime
nlimthermal= 2.5 # limit for 1/n to go to thermal regime
nmaxlim=     3.0  #maximum acceptable gamma. above it KX is forced
gammalim=    1.e3 # maximum acceptable gamma. above it KX is forced    
Jfitlim=     1.e-20 # limit of current approximation above which interpolation is allowed. If J<Jfitlim fitting is forced
varlim=      1.e-3 #limit of variance for the fitting approximation (has meaning for mode==-2). If the fitting variance is more than varlim we switch to spline mode
epsfit=      1.e-4 #  accuracy required in fittings
Nmaxpoly=    10 #    max degree of the fitted polynomial
spectra=     F #  set to true if you want to output spectroscopy data (T or F)
